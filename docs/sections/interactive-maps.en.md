# Interactive Maps

**Interactive maps** let you navigate the places of an adventure visually on a real map image, using clickable markers linked to place records.

They are designed for cases where a simple tree structure is no longer enough and you want to move through the campaign space in a more natural way, for example across:

- a city
- a castle
- a district
- a dungeon
- a region

## What They Are For

Interactive maps are useful when you want to:

- use a map as the main navigation surface
- open places by clicking visual markers
- give the campaign a clearer spatial structure
- move from a detailed map to a broader one

They do not replace **Places** and they do not replace **Concept Maps**:

- **Places** remain the real records of the campaign
- **Concept Maps** are used to show logical and narrative relationships
- **Interactive Maps** are instead used to navigate real places on top of a map image

## Where They Come From

Interactive maps are not a separate record type created in some other module. They are born from **map images** linked to places.

In practice:

1. you link one or more `Map` images to a place
2. you choose which one should be used as the default interactive map
3. you add markers to that map and link them to places

## Where They Are Used

Interactive maps live inside **Places and Quests**.

They can be used in two ways:

- as an **integrated interactive mode** inside the places dashboard
- as a **large map panel** opened from `Media`

## Difference Between Integrated Mode and Large Panel

### Integrated Interactive Mode

When the adventure has maps available, inside the places dashboard you can switch from the normal view to the `Interactive` view.

In this mode:

- the left side of the screen shows the map instead of the classic place tree
- the right panel continues showing the detail of the selected place
- clicking markers lets you navigate directly through places

### Large Map Panel

From the `Media` panel of a place, you can also open an interactive map inside a larger dedicated panel.

This mode is particularly useful when you want to:

- edit markers
- fix links
- work on the map with greater precision

## How to Prepare an Interactive Map

The correct flow is:

1. open the place that should own the map
2. go to `Media`
3. add one or more images of type `Map`
4. choose which one should become the default interactive map
5. open the interactive map
6. create markers and link them to places

## How the Default Map Is Chosen

A place can have more than one linked map. Among them, one can be marked as the default interactive map.

When DnDino needs to decide which map to show for a place, it follows this logic:

- if the place has a map explicitly selected as interactive, it uses that
- otherwise it uses the first available map of that place
- if the place has no maps of its own, it may use a parent place map

## Relationship Between Place and Map

Every interactive map belongs to a place.

The place that owns the map is not necessarily the only place you can open from it: markers can link to any place in the adventure structure.

## Entering Interactive Mode

Inside the `Places` dashboard, when maps are available, you can switch to the `Interactive` view.

In that mode you find:

- interactive map header
- `Map` selector
- optional `Back` button
- optional `Upper level` button
- `Show marker names` toggle
- zoom controls
- the map canvas

## Map Selector

The `Map` menu lets you choose which map to display from the maps available in the adventure.

## Navigation Between Maps

Interactive mode supports two kinds of navigation between maps.

### Back

The `Back` button returns you to the previously displayed map.

### Upper Level

If the current place has a parent place that owns an interactive map, the `Upper level` button may appear.

This lets you move back to a broader map.

## The Map Canvas

The canvas is the central surface where the real map is displayed.

Here you can:

- view the map
- see markers
- click or double-click markers
- use zoom and pan

## Zoom and Movement

Interactive maps support:

- zoom in and out
- zoom reset
- horizontal and vertical scrolling
- panning by dragging the map
- pinch gesture
- mouse-wheel zoom when the cursor is over the map

## Show Marker Names

With the `Show marker names` toggle you can decide whether marker labels should also be visible directly on top of the map.

When active:

- each marker can show its own title or, if the title is empty, the name of the linked place

When inactive:

- only the marker icons remain visible

## How Markers Work

A marker contains:

- normalized position on the map
- optional title
- optional link to a place

The marker is saved relative to the map coordinates and therefore stays in the correct position even when zoom changes.

Markers also change color based on the status of the linked place, so the map gives you a clearer at-a-glance sense of exploration progress:

- `gray` for `Unvisited` places
- `orange` for places `Currently visiting`
- `green` for `Visited` places

These colors are fixed and do not change with the active theme, so their meaning stays consistent across the app.

## Marker Behavior in Read Mode

When you are not in edit mode:

- a **single click** selects a marker
- a **double click** opens the linked place

In integrated interactive mode, opening a place means updating the right panel immediately.

In the large map panel, opening a place closes the map panel and returns focus to the selected place in the dashboard.

## How to Create a Marker

To create a marker in the large map panel:

1. open the interactive map from `Media`
2. press `Edit`
3. press `New marker`
4. choose the place to associate
5. click a point on the map

## Edit Mode

In the large panel there is a real edit state.

When you press `Edit`:

- the map enters editing mode
- you can create new markers
- you can select existing markers to edit them
- you can drag markers to reposition them

![Interactive map in edit mode](../images/en_mappainterattiva_edit.png){ .img-hero }

When you press `Lock`, you leave edit mode.

## New Marker

When you activate `New marker`:

- DnDino first asks you to choose the place to associate
- then it asks you to click the map to position it

## Choosing the Linked Place

When you are creating or editing a marker, the inspector on the right shows the place selector.

From here you can:

- search by name
- see places arranged in a hierarchy
- assign the marker to the correct place

## Editing an Existing Marker

When a marker is selected in edit mode, you can modify in the inspector:

- `Marker title`
- `Linked place`

If the title is left empty, DnDino falls back to the linked place name or to a generic title.

## Moving a Marker

In edit mode, you can drag a marker to a new point on the map.

At the end of the drag, DnDino saves:

- new X position
- new Y position

## Deleting a Marker

Also from the inspector, when a marker is selected, you can use:

- `Delete marker`

## The Map Inspector

The side panel of the large map changes depending on the current state.

### In Read Mode

If you are not editing, the inspector simply shows the list of existing markers.

### While Creating a Marker

If `New marker` is active, the inspector shows:

- instructions
- search field
- list of selectable places

### While Editing a Marker

If you have selected an existing marker, the inspector shows:

- title field
- linked place selector
- current place summary
- button to delete the marker

## Marker List

The marker list in the inspector can also be used for navigation.

Each row shows:

- marker title
- linked place, if any

In read mode, clicking a row opens the linked place.

## How the Map Behaves in Integrated Mode

When you use `Interactive` mode directly inside the places dashboard:

- the map follows the selected place
- DnDino tries to show the most suitable map for that place
- if the place has no map of its own, it may use a map from an upper level

## Inheriting a Map from a Parent Place

A very useful part of the system is that a place can also use a map from an upper level.

This allows scenarios such as:

- a district using the city map
- a room using the castle map
- a point of interest using the region map

## How to Open an Interactive Map from Media

In the `Media` panel of a place, maps of type `Map` can show the action:

- `Open interactive map`

## When It Makes Sense to Use Integrated Mode

Integrated interactive mode is the best choice when you want to:

- navigate quickly between places
- work with the map and the place panel side by side
- use the map as an alternative to the classic tree

## When It Makes Sense to Use the Large Panel

The large panel is the better choice when you want to:

- create markers
- move markers
- change links
- work with greater precision

## In Practice

Interactive maps are the right tool when you want to give places a real spatial dimension.

The core idea is simple:

- the **place** remains the main record
- the **map** becomes the visual surface
- the **marker** is the operational link between image and content
